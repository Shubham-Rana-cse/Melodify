# MELODIFY

This is my second Web-Devlopment project which is Web Music Player extensively inspired frmo "Spotidy-Web Player". This has been made purely using HTML, CSS and JS.

In this project I tried to implement and explore every HTML, CSS and JS concept which I read.

"Though this seems to be a minor-project but the learnig for me was more than a major one could make without much efforts."
Many more things to implement, however core  learning was grabbed!!
Happy learning...
